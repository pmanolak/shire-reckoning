How the Calendar of Imladris drifts apart from the Gregorian calendar
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Calendar of Imladris starts reckoning on a proleptic Gregorian year 1, March 22nd,
and because the Gregorian calendar has a leap-year every 4 years but the Calendar of Imladris only has a leap-year every 12,
then in years 1 - 12 Rivendell New Year's Day (Yestarë) will fall on
March 22, 22, 22, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20, 20, 20, 20, and 19.
When the Calendar of Imladris has its first leap-year in year 12,
it adds 3 extra Middle-days (Enderi) which allows Yestarë to fall on March 22 once again in year 13.
This pattern of Yestarë falling on March 22 - 19 repeats for years 13 - 24,
and every 12 years until year 100.

The Calendar of Imladris will have had a leap-year in year 96,
so Yestarë would fall on March 22 again in year 97.
Since the proleptic Gregorian calendar omits its leap-day in year 100,
its next leap-year is not until year 104,
and since the Calendar of Imladris' next leap-year would be in year 108,
then in years 97 - 108 Yestarë would fall on
March 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 21, 21, 21, 21, and 20.
Then in years 109 - 120 Yestarë would fall on
March 23, 23, 23, 22, 22, 22, 22, 21, 21, 21, 21, and 20.
This means the 12-year pattern of Yestarë dates in March has shifted
so that Yestarë now falls between March 23 - 20 in years 108 - 204.

Since the proleptic Gregorian calendar omits another leap-day in year 200,
the cycle shifts again in 204 so that Yestarë falls between March 24 - 21 in years 204 - 300.
Once again, the Gregorian calendar omits its leap-day in year 300.
Since that year is a leap-year in the Calendar of Imladris,
Yestarë then falls on March 25 in year 301,
and the cycle shifts again so that Yestarë falls between March 25 - 22 in years 300 - 432.

Note that the Gregorian calendar does not omit its leap-day in years divisible by 400,
which is why this pattern continues past year 400,
but recall that the Calendar of Imladris omits its 3 extra Enderi every 432 years.
So Yestarë does not "leap" from March 22 in the year 432 to March 25 in year 433,
so in years 428 - 444 Yestarë would fall on
March 23, 23, 23, 23, 22, 22, 22, 22, 21, 21, 21, 21, 20, 20, 20, 20, and 19.
This means that the Calendar of Imladris 432-year cycle
has put it back in sync with this proleptic Gregorian calendar's 400-year cycle,
so that Yestarë falls on March 22 - 19 once again in years 432 - 500 (the same pattern as years 1 - 100).

Now note that this 32 year difference between these calendars' cycles will add up, so that after the year 1700,
the Gregorian calendar's shorter 400-year cycle will have omitted 1 more leap-day
than the Calendar of Imladris 432-year cycle will have omitted by the end of year 1728.
This causes the Calendar of Imladris 432-year cycle to permanently shift a day ahead
of the Gregorian calendar's 400-year cycle,
so that the pattern of Yestarë dates in March becomes the following:

* Yestarë falls on March 23 - 20 in years 1728 - 1800.
* Yestarë falls on March 24 - 21 in years 1801 - 1908.
* Yestarë falls on March 25 - 22 in years 1909 - 2100.
* Yestarë falls on March 26 - 23 in years 2101 - 2160.

Then in 2160 the Calendar of Imladris omits its 3 extra Enderi
and the pattern of Yestarë dates in March becomes the following:

* Yestarë falls on March 23 - 20 in years 2160 - 2207.
* Yestarë falls on March 24 - 21 in years 2208 - 2304.
* Yestarë falls on March 25 - 22 in years 2305 - 2508.
* Yestarë falls on March 26 - 23 in years 2509 - 2592.

Then in 2592 the Calendar of Imladris omits its 3 extra Enderi
and the pattern of Yestarë dates in March becomes the following:

* Yestarë falls on March 23 - 21 in years 2592 - 2604.
* Yestarë falls on March 24 - 21 in years 2605 - 2700.
* Yestarë falls on March 25 - 22 in years 2701 - 2904.
* Yestarë falls on March 26 - 23 in years 2905 - 3000.
* Yestarë falls on March 27 - 24 in years 3001 - 3024.

Gradually, over the millennia,
the Calendar of Imladris 432-year cycle will continue to drift ahead of the Gregorian calendar's 400-year cycle
so that Yestarë will fall on later and later dates in the Gregorian calendar.
