## What's this all about?

As mentioned in the Shire Reckoning notes on
"[Reckoning with moon phases](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#reckoning-with-moon-phases)",
it is demonstrated in [The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#references)
that Tolkien used the actual moon phases of 1941-1942 as a reference when describing the moon (or lack of moon) during certain events in
[The Lord of the Rings](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#references),
but these moon phases only align with the dates in the narrative if those Shire Calendar dates start reckoning their year
from December 25 in 1940 and 1941.
Also mentioned in those notes is the concept that
[moon phases repeat on approximately the same dates every 19 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle),
and these 1941-2 moon phases repeated on most of the same dates in 2017-18
(with some falling [1 day earlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callippic_cycle)).

So starting in the spring of 2017 (or really the previous fall) I led myself and my brother in a "Lunar Readalong",
re-reading LOTR in "real-time" in 2017-18, according to the moon phases and approximately at the same time-of-year as described in the story,
with the help of *The Lord of the Rings* Appendix B, the *Reader's Companion*, and this project's
[Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html).

I also posted my progress to the
[/r/tolkienfans subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/63kee3/lotr_lunar_readalong_chapter_2_april_5_6_and_more/),
and I made some notes as I went on some of my real-world observations of the moon on those dates.
I've now collected my results here, along with an example alignment for 2020-21 dates and moon phases.

If anyone else wishes to attempt this Readalong,
a close approximation can probably be achieved in any year by aligning the full moon nearest to the beginning of March with Rethe 8
(the moon phase that is probably more important to the story than any other moon phase described),
and this project's [Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html)
can help align the Shire dates with the dates in our calendar in that year.

Also see [Shire-Reckoning.com's Moon Phases in The Lord of the Rings](http://shire-reckoning.com/moon.html)
for additional details and for direct quotes from *The Lord of the Rings*
where the moon is described on specific dates in the story.

## Caveats

This is **not recommended for first-time readers**,
and needless to say **this page will contain book spoilers**.

Even though I found it interesting to re-read the story in chronological order,
while observing the real-world moon along with the descriptions of it in the story,
those who have already read *The Lord of the Rings* before might not want to read to such a sparse schedule,
or rearranged from its original, "overlapping" order the way Tolkien meant it to be read.

At the beginning of the *Reader's Companion* Book Three, Chapter 1,
Hammond and Scull quote Richard C. West, who,
"in 'The Interlace Structure of *The Lord of the Rings*', *A Tolkien Compass* (1975),
points out that this overlapping or 'interlacing' was a medieval form of storytelling":

> Interlace... seeks to mirror the perception of the flux of events in the world around us,
> where everything is happening at once...
> Also, the narrator implies there are innumerable events that he has not had time to tell us about...
> Yet the apparently casual form of the interlace is deceptive: it actually has a very subtle kind of cohesion.
> No part of the narrative can be removed without damage to the whole...

Which I think emphasizes again that attempting to read *The Lord of the Rings* in chronological order is
**not recommended for first-time readers**.

With that said, perhaps this Readalong chart could still help those who are re-reading *The Lord of the Rings* in its original order,
and want to cross-reference previous chapters of the story to see what else was happening at the same time
as the passage they are currently reading.

Perhaps this project can also spark some curiosity in amateur astronomy for those who might not usually pay attention to the real-world moon.
Then they can use this scheme to observe the real-world moon themselves,
during a similar time of year as in the story,
and they can see just how the moon would have looked to the story's characters,
or when it would have risen or set (give or take an hour) over certain events.
As noted above, they would have to align the full moon nearest to the beginning of March with Rethe 8,
and use this project's [Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html)
to align all the other Shire dates with the dates in our calendar in that year.

## Format of this Lunar Readalong Scheme

### Shire date

The first column gives the date of the event according to Shire Reckoning.
A specific date is not always given for some events,
so those dates will be marked with `(approx.)` to indicate that the date is approximate.

Often a character will recount past events to the other characters of the story.
I've listed many of those events here on the date the event originally took place on,
and not on the date that character is recalling the event.
So dates marked with `(retrospect)` indicate that date is the original date of that event.

#### Key to the Moon Phase Emojis

I'm including an emoji of the appropriate moon phase for certain dates in the scheme below.
If the event for that day includes any mention of the moon on that date,
then I'll include the appropriate moon phase emoji before the Shire date.
If the date is on one of the moon's quarter phases (new ðŸŒ‘ / 1st ðŸŒ“ / full ðŸŒ• / last ðŸŒ—),
or maybe if the event for that day does not mention the moon but mentions the night sky,
then I'll include the appropriate moon phase emoji in parentheses after the Shire date.

|Emoji|Moon phase description|
| --- | -------------------- |
|ðŸŒ‘|new moon|
|ðŸŒ’|waxing crescent|
|ðŸŒ“|1st quarter|
|ðŸŒ”|waxing gibbous|
|ðŸŒ•|full moon|
|ðŸŒ–|waning gibbous|
|ðŸŒ—|last quarter|
|ðŸŒ˜|waning crescent|

### 2020-21 alignment

The scheme includes an example alignment for dates and moon phases in 2020-21.

As mentioned above, a close approximation of aligning the moon phases in a different year
can probably be achieved by aligning the full moon nearest to the beginning of March with Rethe 8
(the moon phase that is probably more important to the story than any other moon phase described).

See the directions on [how to use the Middle-earth calendar simulations](#how-to-use-these-calendar-simulations),
and also the [Moon phases](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#moon-phases)
"Synchronize settings", for more details and directions on how to align Shire dates for a different year.

I'm including real-world 2019 dates for Chapter 1 that should be close to the same time of year
and to what the moon phase should be in that part of the story.
The real-world 2019 dates also let 6 months stand-in for the 17-year gap of the story.

### Book.Chapter

I'm using Book and Chapter notation where "Book 1, Chapter 1" is `I.1`, and "Book 6, Chapter 9" is `VI.9`.

### Page Start

Page numbers are as given in the *Reader's Companion*,
which are either for the 2005 single volume,
or for the previous standard 3-volume hardback editions (such as the 1965 publication).
The *Reader's Companion* 3-volume page numbers are given as `Volume:Page`,
so the end of the story is listed as `1031 (III:311)`,
which is page 1031 in the single-volume edition, or Volume III page 311 of the 3-volume edition.
Hopefully using Roman numerals also for the [Book.Chapter](#bookchapter) notation isn't too confusing.

### Read until

Since not everyone can use these page numbers,
a snippet of the passage where I think the story ends on each date is also listed.

Since [Shire dates are reckoned from midnight to midnight](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#reckoning-the-start-or-end-of-a-day)
(just like our modern dates),
I've put each cutoff as close to midnight as possible.
I'll leave it to the discretion of the reader to decide when to read pre-dawn events past the midnight cutoffs,
since some events span an entire night
(for example the snowstorm on Caradhras is mostly in the pre-dawn hours of Afteryule 12).

For anyone who is curious,
the amount to read on the day of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Rethe 15, was second only to the reading on Rethe 5,
the day of the parley with Saruman in Orthanc and when Pippin looks into palantÃ­r.
Using the 1965 edition as reference, it was about 50 vs. 60 pages
(or more if you read past the midnight cutoffs until the story gets to morning, as I've tended to do).

Since the readings on these dates were mostly action and dialog,
I thought they were fairly quick readings anyway.

### Event Summary

A summary of the events for each date is provided, and is usually just quoted from *The Tale of Years* (Appendix B).
If no summary is provided for that date in Appendix B, then I try to use a quote from the story,
otherwise I'll provide my own summary.

### Notes

As mentioned above,
I made some notes as I read along with the 2017-18 scheme on some of my real-world observations of the moon for some dates.
Those notes are provided in the last column of the scheme below,
along with various other notes for certain events.

## Lunar Readalong Grand Scheme

|Shire date|2020-21|Book.Chapter|Page Start|Read until|Event Summary|Notes|
| -------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
|1401 Halimath (approx.) 16|2019Â SeptemberÂ 12|I.1|21 (I:29) [start of chapter]|Before long the invitations began pouring out...|Preparations for Bilbo's 111th Birthday Party.|The 16th is the end of the 2nd full week of Halimath. The 2019 dates were only chosen to closely match the moon of S.R. 1401 Halimath 22, and to let 6 months stand-in for the 17-year gap of the story.
|Halimath 21|September 16| |26 (I:34)|Thursday, September the 22nd...|Eve of Bilbo's 111th Birthday Party.|
|Halimath 22 (ðŸŒ–)|September 17| | |Night passed slowly. The sun rose.|Bilbo's 111th Birthday Party.|The moon is not mentioned in this part of the story, but note that Bilbo's 130th birthday, which is also listed in Appendix B, falls 19 years later and so would fall on approximately the same moon phase.
|Halimath 23|September 18|I.1 - 2|37 (I:45)|43 (I:52) "There were rumors of strange things"|Summary of the days and the 17 years following Bilbo's Party.|
|1418 Astron 12 (ðŸŒ”)|2020Â AprilÂ 2|I.2|43 (I:52)|Next morning...|"Gandalf reaches Hobbiton" in the early evening.|There was no moon described in Chapter 2 (except in general with regards to Gollum), but it was still nice knowing what it should have looked like as Sam walked home from The Green Dragon, and when Gandalf knocked on Frodo's study window :) It would have been a waxing moon, just past its 1st quarter, and it would have been practically at its peak in the southern sky as Sam walked home at twilight.
|Astron 13|April 3| |46 (I:55)|[end of chapter]|Gandalf tells Frodo about the One Ring in the morning.|
|(approx.) Astron 30|April 20|I.3|65 (I:74)|One summer's evening...|Frodo makes plans for leaving the Shire.|
|(retrospect) Thrimidge 1|April 21|I.10|172 (I:184) "When did you last see Gandalf?"|And that has proved ill.|Gandalf meets Strider at the Sarn Ford.|
|(approx.) Forelithe 2 (ðŸŒ‘)|May 22|I.3|66 (I:75)|Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months.|News travels of the sale of Bag End.|There is no date given by Tolkien for the selling of Bag End, or for the next section in chapter 3 when news of the sale reaches the Ivy Bush and Green Dragon "one summer's evening". Since this is a "Lunar" Readalong, I figure why not put this event on the new moon on Forelithe 2.
|(retrospect) Forelithe 19|June 8|II.2|246 (I:259) "For on the eve of the sudden assault..."|And the Halfling forth shall stand.|Faramir dreams of Isildur's Bane for the first time.|
|ðŸŒ– (retrospect) Forelithe 20|June 9| |245 (I:258) "But this very year, in the days of June..."|245 (I:259) "But still we fight on..."|"Sauron attacks Osgiliath."|This is the earliest chronological passage in the story that includes a description of the moon, and it's also the description of the event considered the start of the War of the Ring! Since the moon didn't rise until late in the evening, the attack must have gone on far into the night, and I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't start until after dark.
|(retrospect / approx.)| | |255 (I:268) "In the days of fair weather we led Gollum through the woods..."|256 (I:269) "Mirkwood is again an evil place, save where our realm is maintained."|"Thranduil is attacked, and Gollum escapes."|
|(approx.) Forelithe 29|June 18|I.3|67 (I:76)|He went off at dawn.|Gandalf tells Frodo he will depart from Bag End next morning.|
|(approx.) Forelithe 30|June 19| | |Autumn was well under way...|Gandalf departs from Bag End.|If Gandalf didn't depart Bag End until Forelithe 30, then I think it would be very unlikely for the moon to be visible to the naked eye that dawn, since it was just 1 day before a new moon.
|(retrospect) Mid-year's Day|June 21|II.2|256 (I:269) "At the end of June..."|258 (I:271) "I rode away at dawn..."|"Gandalf meets Radagast."|
|(retrospect)| |I.10|169 (I:182) [start of Gandalf's letter]|Frodo read the letter to himself...|Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo with Butterbur.|
|(retrospect) Afterlithe 4|June 26|II.2|246 (I:259) "Of these words we could understand little..."|...long have I wandered by roads forgotten...|"Boromir sets out from Minas Tirith" for Rivendell.|Boromir sets off for Rivendell just a couple of days before the 1st quarter moon. That gives him quite a few nights at the start of his journey with plenty of moonlight in the evenings.
|(retrospect) Afterlithe 10|July 2| |258 (I:271) "...I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman."|261 (I:274) "...would falter in the Shire far away."|"Gandalf imprisoned in Orthanc" by Saruman.|Since Gandalf arrived at Isengard before midnight (otherwise the date would have been "early hours of Afterlithe 11"), the waxing gibbous moon (only a couple of days from full) must have still been rising in the western sky, or if it was late enough, it could have been near its zenith in the southern sky. I wonder if the sky was clear enough that the moonlight illuminated Orthanc has he approached the stair of Saruman...
|ðŸŒ– (retrospect) Halimath 18|September 8| |261 (I:274) "I was in an evil plight..."|262 (I:275) "The rest must be more brief."|Gandalf rescued from Orthanc by Gwaihir before dawn.|This waning gibbous moon would have been near its zenith in the southern sky about an hour before dawn, when the stars were still out.
|Halimath 20|September 10|I.3|67 (I:76)|67 (I:77) "The next day...."|Frodo has packed and sends his belongings to Buckland.|The 2 covered carts that took Frodo's belongings to Buckland would have had the morning sun rising before them on the Great East Road, with a moon less than 1 day past its 3rd quarter sinking behind them in the west.
|Halimath 21|September 11| |67 (I:77)|Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned...|Frodo still awaits Gandalf.|
|Halimath 22 (ðŸŒ˜)|September 12| | |The next morning...|Frodo's farewell birthday dinner at Bag End.|At the end of Frodo's 50th birthday party, he and his friends would have no moon to obstruct their "glimpse of the stars" that evening, since the moon was just a few days from new, and it wouldn't have risen until just a couple of hours before dawn. Maybe the moon had already risen when the Black Riders entered the Shire.
|Halimath 23|September 13| | |72 (I:81) "The morning came, pale and clammy..."|"A Black Rider comes to Hobbiton at nightfall. Frodo leaves Bag End."|
|ðŸŒ˜ Halimath 24|September 14| |72 (I:81)|[end of chapter]|Frodo and company encounter a Black Rider on the road, then meet Gildor and his company in the moonless evening.|Since the moon is only a couple of days from new, almost the entire night would be moonless (except for maybe a crescent rising in the hour before dawn).
|Halimath 25|September 15|I.4 - 5|86 (I:95)|[end of chapter 5]|Frodo and company pass through Old Farmer Maggot's land, then escape a Black Rider by crossing the Brandywine on the Bucklebury Ferry.|
|Halimath 26 (ðŸŒ˜)|September 16|I.6 - 7|[start of chapter 6]|128 (I:139) "They woke up, all four at once..."|"The Old Forest. Frodo comes to Bombadil."|
|Halimath 27 (ðŸŒ‘)|September 17|I.7 - 8|128 (I:139)|135 (I:146) "The vision melted into waking..."|"In the House of Tom Bombadil".|I wonder if Goldberry intentionally waited for the new moon for her "washing day" and "autumn-cleaning".
|Halimath 28 (ðŸŒ’)|September 18|I.8|135 (I:146)|140? (I:151) "When he came to himself again..."|"The Hobbits captured by a Barrow-wight."|
|Halimath 29 (ðŸŒ’)|September 19|I.8 - 11|140? (I:151)|176 (I:188) "There was a faint stir in the leaves..."|The hobbits are rescued by Tom Bombadil. "Frodo reaches Bree at night."|The thin crescent moon would have set in the west within a couple of hours of sunset.
|(retrospect) Halimath 29|September 19|II.2|262 (I:276) "True indeed!"|Then I rode on in fear.|Gandalf finishes his recounting of taming Shadowfax, and riding from Edoras to the Shire. "Gandalf visits the Gaffer."|

|(retrospect)| |II.2|263 (I:277)|At sunrise I escaped...|Gandalf "is attacked at night on Weathertop."|Since Gandalf doesn't escape Weathertop until sunrise, at least 1/2 his battle with the NazgÃ»l would have been under a moonless sky (during the hours between midnight and dawn).
|(retrospect) Winterfilth 4|September 24| | |264 (I:278) "That helped a little..."|Gandalf escapes Weathertop.|

It wouldn't even rise until nearly midnight, and it wouldn't pass its zenith in the southern sky until a couple of hours before before dawn. So it could not shine directly on the door (which is surrounded by westward-facing cliffs) until it moved into the western skies between midnight and dawn.

The moon would have risen right around midnight, and it would have passed into the western skies by dawn, so when Frodo sees "the sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves", it must have been between midnight and dawn on Afteryule 16. However, since the moon was only hours away from its third quarter, it should have appeared as 1/2 full, but not yet like a "sickle" for another night or 2.
